# ML-Olympiad--Water-Quality-Prediction

Hello everyone, I am excited to share my journey participating in the water quality estimation competition. The competition required us to build a machine learning model based on the training data provided and predict the water quality estimation for the test dataset accurately.

I put my knowledge of machine learning and data analysis into practice to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data. I explored various regression techniques and hyperparameters to find the best model for this task.

After numerous iterations, I was able to build a model that achieved high accuracy in predicting the water quality estimation for the test dataset. My hard work and dedication paid off as I secured the 18th position in the competition.

I am sharing the code I used for this prediction task (regression) below, hoping that it can help and inspire others to pursue their interests in machine learning.
